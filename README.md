#Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Data

Project Overview:

This project aims to perform Sentiment Analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset to classify the sentiment of each review as positive or negative. The main objective is to understand how machine learning models can be used to automatically predict the sentiment of a movie review based on its textual content. This project uses a variety of techniques, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Vectorization, and Machine Learning Models to achieve this.

Key Features-

1. IMDB Dataset: The project leverages a publicly available dataset of movie reviews from IMDB, which contains labeled data for positive and negative reviews.

2. Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed to clean and prepare it for machine learning, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

3. Text Vectorization: Various methods like TF-IDF or Word2Vec are applied to convert textual data into numerical representations.

4. Sentiment Classification: Different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Deep Learning are employed to classify the sentiment of each review.

5. Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


Technologies Used-

1. Python for data analysis and modeling.

2. Pandas for data manipulation.

3. Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

4. NLTK for Natural Language Processing tasks.

5. TensorFlow/Keras (optional) for deep learning models (if implemented).

6. Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization.

 
How It Works-

1. Data Loading: The IMDB dataset is loaded and split into training and test sets.

2. Data Preprocessing: Textual data is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into vectors.

3. Model Training: The model is trained on the training set, and hyperparameters are tuned to improve accuracy.

4. Model Evaluation: The model is tested on the unseen test data, and various performance metrics are calculated to assess its effectiveness.


Future Work-

Experiment with deep learning models like RNN or LSTM to improve sentiment classification accuracy.

Implement Hyperparameter Tuning using Grid Search or Random Search.

Expand to handle multi-class sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).

Explore Transfer Learning techniques to fine-tune pre-trained models like BERT or GPT for sentiment analysis tasks.
